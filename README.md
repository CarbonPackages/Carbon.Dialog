# Carbon.Dialog Package for Neos CMS

This package provides a tiny fusion helper for dialogues.

## [Carbon.Dialog:Dialog](Resources/Private/Fusion/Dialog.fusion)

## [Carbon.Dialog:Button](Resources/Private/Fusion/Button.fusion)

## Installation

Most of the time you have to make small adjustments to a package (e.g.
configuration in `Settings.yaml`). Because of that, it is important to add the
corresponding package to the composer from your theme package. Mostly this is
the site packages located under `Packages/Sites/`. To install it correctly go to
your theme package (e.g.`Packages/Sites/Foo.Bar`) and run following command:

```bash
composer require carbon/dialog --no-update
```

The `--no-update` command prevent the automatic update of the dependencies.
After the package was added to your theme `composer.json`, go back to the root
of the Neos installation and run `composer update`. Et voil√†! Your desired
package is now installed correctly.
